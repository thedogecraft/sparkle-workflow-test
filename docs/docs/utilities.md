# Utilities Page

!!! note "Comprehensive System Utilities"

    The Utilities page provides direct access to system maintenance tools and settings management with intuitive controls. All utilities run PowerShell scripts behind the scenes and sync with your Windows configuration.

## How It Works

- **Toggle**: Enable/disable features with a switch. Automatically detects current state.
- **Button**: Execute one-time actions like cleaning, repairing, or restarting services.

All utilities automatically check your current system settings on page load and show toast notifications for success/failure. PowerShell scripts run in the background to apply changes.
